        <p><b class="bold">Cough</b> is a reflex action that helps clear your airways of mucus, irritants, or foreign particles. It's a common symptom of various respiratory infections, allergies, or conditions such as colds, flu, bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, or even environmental irritants like smoke or dust. Coughing can be productive (bringing up mucus or phlegm) or dry (without producing any mucus). It serves as a protective mechanism for your body to expel irritants and maintain clear air passages. However, persistent or severe coughing may indicate an underlying health issue and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.<br><b class="bold">Coughing can be caused</b> by respiratory infections, allergies, environmental irritants, asthma, acid reflux, postnasal drip, medications, COPD, lung diseases, or psychological factors like stress.</p>
